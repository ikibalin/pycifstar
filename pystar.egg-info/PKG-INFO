Description: # StarPy 
        ***
        
        [StarPy] is a crystallographic library for neutron data analysis. Based on the library *NeuPy* a script *RhoChi* allows to refine polarized neutron diffraction experiments performed with single crystals as well as with powder magnetic compounds. A console version is given together with a simple GUI viewer.
